Located in northern Franklin County, Route 27 is filled with outdoor adventures, historic towns, authentic culture, and spectacular scenery. This 47-mile byway also serves as a principal corridor connecting the State of Maine with the Canadian Province of Quebec.

At the southern end of byway, Kingfield provides numerous visitor services and amenities. Park the car and explore this beautiful village on foot. Visit the Stanley Museum, go shopping downtown, and walk along side streets lined with historic homes.

Traveling north from Kingfield, the Carrabassett River winds alongside the byway, beckoning you to swim or fly fish in the clear and cold mountain waters.

As you drive, be on the lookout for moose. Often weighing over 1,000 pounds, moose make frequent appearances along this byway where they feed on roadside vegetation. If you want to guarantee a sighting, locals can tell you about the best places and times to see one; just don't forget your camera.

When you reach the town of Carrabassett Valley, you'll find yourself in a small town with big outdoor recreational opportunities. Enjoy the region's highly rated golf and downhill skiing facilities, and over 65 miles of cross-country ski trails.

Drive a few miles north of Sugarloaf and hike the legendary Appalachian Trail, which will take you into the 34,500-acre Bigelow Preserve where an extensive network of hiking trails provides both day length and extended backcountry experiences.

As you continue north, you'll enter the small town of Stratton. Area stores can outfit you for fishing on the 16,650-acre Flagstaff Lake or for snowmobiling on the many miles of groomed trails in the area. From Stratton, you can also follow Route 16 west to Rangeley and the Rangeley Lakes Scenic Byway.

Continuing north from Stratton, follow the byway as it traces part of the historic path that Benedict Arnold and 1,100 American troops took in 1775 in an attempt to overthrow the British in Quebec City. Military buffs love looking for artifacts in this area. From there, you'll travel through the Boundary Mountains, winding alongside the Dead River and the Chain of Ponds on your way to Coburn Gore, the byway's northern gateway at the Canadian border. The ancient rock formations in this region are over 400 million years old, and they will provide you with a final taste of outstanding scenery and natural studies.
