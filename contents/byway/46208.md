<p>This hardwood forest byway features the Kinzua Bridge, the remains of a 19th Century railroad viaduct, built in 1882 of iron. At the time, it was the longest and tallest railroad bridge in the world at 2,053 feet long and 301 feet high. It was rebuilt of steel in 1900 and carried rail traffic until 1959. The Kinzua Bridge was placed in the National Register of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks in 1977. Eleven of the 20 towers of the Kinzua Bridge were destroyed by a tornado in July, 2003, collapsing the center part of the bridge.</p>
