History-rich, this route follows the early 19th Century Accommodation (stagecoach) Line. It is dotted by historic farms and has large historic districts at both ends. Large sections of the Underground Railroad are buried underneath many homes on this byway.

Recreation on this byway is choice. Lakes, rivers, and two state parks offer birding, hunting, fishing, boating, camping, canoeing, and swimming. The famous Little Miami Scenic Trail is a 63-mile paved, river-side trail for rollerblading, walking, jogging, biking, and horseback riding. This trail is flanked by observation towers, benches, marshes, gorges, and many, many trees.
