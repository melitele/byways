  "fullDescription": "<p>Take a drive that winds by the monarch of the mountains.\r\nCrowders Mountain Drive, named for one of the early settlers passes\r\na scenic three-mile mountain range and through Crowders Mountain\r\nState Park.</p>\r\n<p>Among the peaks in the mountain range is one called the\r\nPinnacle. It is known as a <dfn>monadnock</dfn>, which is a\r\ngeological feature made from a mass of rock that has resisted\r\nerosion. Because of this phenomenon, the Pinnacle towers high above\r\nthe rest of the peaks like a king.</p>\r\n<p>Because the byway goes through a mountainous area, visitors may\r\nwant to experience rock climbing or hiking in the region. This\r\nshort byway is well worth the twenty minutes drive.</p>\r\n",
