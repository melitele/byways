<p>Take a short drive along North Carolina's coastal area to the
historic town of Brunswick. The town was left in ruins in 1830 and
is now an archealogical site. Travelers with an interest in history
will be delighted in the stories of the area. The byway is on North
Carolina's coast and offers a view of the ocean and beaches of the
area.</p>
<p>In addition to the historic Brunswick Town, the byway also
passes Orton Plantation. The plantation was built in 1725 and
features the man-made Orton Pond. Sunbathing alligators find the
area appealing as well.</p>
<p>Travelers may be content to spend their time exploring areas of
the byway, but if that isn't the case, there are plenty of places
worth stopping at along the Cape Fear River. There's something for
everyone along the Brunswick Town Road.</p>
