Prior to European settlement in the early 1800s, Ohio contained about a thousand square miles of prairies which comprised about two and a half percent of the vegetation of the state at the time. These prairies were mostly scattered around the western half of the state and varied in size from a few acres to several thousand acres. One of the largest concentration of prairies occurred in the Darby Plains. Small, but excellent remnants of this prairie ecosystem can be seen today along the Big Darby Plains Scenic Byway. The byway features access to the scenic river, nature preserves and parks. There are also several covered and historic bridges, century farms, cemeteries, and homes of interest along the routes as it passes by North Lewisburg and through Milford Center, Unionville Center and Plain City.
