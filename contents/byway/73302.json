  "fullDescription": "<p>View rich orchards, vineyards, and fruit markets along the Sho-Me Santa Fe Trail.  Explore the hills of the Missouri river banks where Lewis and Clark once traveled. Walk in the steps of the Native Americans, fur traders and trappers back when this route was called Boones Lick Trail. Follow in the steps of the Civil War Troops as they marched to the Battle of Lexington. Imagine the Santa Fe Trail back when it once ran stagecoaches and covered wagons during the westward expansion of the 19th century. Come see the beauty of the hills and experience the rich history of the Sho-Me Santa Fe Trails Byway.</p><p>Sho-Me Santa Fe Trails Byway starts in Waverly on US 65 and continues westward on US 24 stopping at Lexington where the Old Trails Road Byway picks up at state highway 224.  The Sho-Me Santa Fe Trails Byway runs 20.5 miles, and the byway lies approximately 17 miles north of exit 58 on I-70.</p>",
