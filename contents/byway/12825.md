Journey this byway to historic and archaeological areas relating to American Indian culture. The road travels through some of North Carolina's quiet towns providing a scenic drive with a few pleasant stops. Travelers will drive through peach country where they may be enticed to stop at a roadside fruitstand for some fresh, plump peaches.

The byway begins the Uwharrie Lakes area in the little town of Ellerbe. Ellerbe was named for W.T. Ellerbe who developed Ellerbe Springs further along the byway. The springs are home to the Historic Ellerbe Springs Inn and Restaurant where some visitors may want to dine and stay for a while to fully enjoy the surroundings.

At the end of the byway, traveler's will find the route's namesake. The Town Creek Indian Mound offers an in depth look at one of the oldest cultures ever to inhabit the lands of North Carolina. The Creek Indians of the Pee Dee peoples built mounds and had ceremonies here nearly 400 years ago. Tour the reconstructed temples and learn more.
