  "fullDescription": "<p>The Abo Pass Trail is a unique highway route which showcases the natural beauty and historic significance of New Mexico.  The Route is located within Socorro, Torrance, and Valencia counties and connects the Salt Missions Trail and El Camino Real Scenic Byways.  This route was an important segment of a Native American trade route first established in 1450 A.D.  The route eventually became part of a trade corridor which linked the Pueblos and the Plains Indians to El Camino Real and a network of trails throughout the Southwest.   The byway offers one of the few remaining pristine and panoramic views of the Manzano Mountains, as well as unspoiled open spaces and a national wildlife refuge.  Those traveling the byway can also see traditional rural lifestyles that have been maintained in small communities along the byway.</p>",
