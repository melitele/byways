This byway, recognized for its beautiful, lunar-like landscape, together with the Rock Rim Drive in the Colorado National Monument became the Tour of the Moon stage of the Coors International Bicycle Classic that ran from 1980 to 1988, a race that originated as the Red Zinger Bicycle Classic from 1975 to 1979 and was sponsored by Celestial Seasonings. The Coors International Bicycle Classic was considered America's answer to the Tour de France, as it was our only national tour
and the fourth largest in the world.

In 1984, the Tour of the Moon stage was depicted in the movie _American Flyers_, starring Kevin Costner.

Today, the Tour of the Moon stage has evolved into the Tour of the Moon Grand Cycling Classic, an annual recreational road ride developed in coordination with the Colorado National Monument
and the Grand Junction Visitor and Convention Bureau beginning in
2012.

It is estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 cyclists ride the route each year; there are also enthusiastic motorcyclists and motorists that use the route in large numbers.
