Named for the 140 square mile swamp it passes through, the Green Swamp Scenic Byway gives visitors a sampling of North Carolina swamplands. The area is described as having peat, muck, and timberland because of little surface water and extensive tree farms. The area is also dense with unique botanical qualites. Unusual plants and flowers can be seen throughout the Green Swamp.

The byway passes through several communities, some of them
historic. The Green Swamp is so vast it separated one of its
communities on the other side of the swamp. It is known as Crusoe Island because of its distant isolation.

Visitors have the option to enjoy the scenery from the car or to get out and explore the swamp at Lake Waccamaw State Park. The state park offers recreational activities like fishing and
picnicking as well as boardwalks for strolling in the area. No
matter which way you decide to tour the Green Swamp, be sure to find a way to enjoy this unique atmosphere.
