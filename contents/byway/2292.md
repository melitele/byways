<p>This scenic byway winds through the hardwood of Sumter National
Forest along the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Turnouts along
the byway provide scenic vistas of the surrounding mountains. Fall
is a popular time for driving the byway with colors of orange, red,
and gold vibrant along the way.</p>
<p>Hikers, backpackers, and horseback riders will be interested in
this byway with the miles of trails running through beautiful
mountains. Maps of the wilderness area and its trails are available
from the Andrew Pickens Ranger District in Walhalla. Other trails
throughout the forest provide opportunities for short walks to
longer day hikes. For a day along the water, the Chattooga River
crosses the national forest. Portions of this river have been
designated a National Wild and Scenic River. The river offers
white-water rapids for those interested. Outfitters can provide all
you need to enjoy a float trip down this wild river. Trout fishing
is also a favorite activity on the river.</p>
<p>After a long day of sightseeing along the byway,there is the
Cherry Hill Recreation Area. It is a national forest campground
located directly along the byway for camping needs. This campground
has 22 tree-shaded sites with picnic tables. Drinking water,
restrooms, and shower facilities are also provided. Oconee State
Park is near the southern end of the byway and has 140 sites with
water and electrical hookups.</p>
