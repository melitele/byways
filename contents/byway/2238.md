A short and lovely drive through the Mississippi River Valley, the Apple Blossom Scenic Byway in eastern Minnesota is known for its rolling hills of apple orchards. Trees are in full blossom in spring and summer, but as you make your way along the byway in the fall, make sure to stop and pick up some fresh apples, apple cider, and pumpkins along the way. Winter provides a picturesque landscape as the hills and apple trees are blanketed with snow and winter birds move into the area.

The 17-mile byway travels Highway 29 along the edge of the Mississippi River and passes through the towns of Nodine and La Crescent. Close to the byway is Great Bluffs State Park, which provides lovers of the outdoors camping and fishing opportunities.
