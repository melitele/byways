  "description": "Scenery along this State Scenic Highway is typical of high desert meadows, with peaks of the Sierra Nevada visible in the west.",
  "fullDescription": "<p>The rugged Sierra Nevada Mountain Range dominates the landscape through which this California state scenic highway travels.  Peaks stretch more than 13,000 feet into the clear alpine skies while rivers plunge over falls and cut canyons deep into the earth.  Clear mountain lakes dot the landscape, providing wonderful recreational opportunities for anyone who enjoys water.  Wildflowers bloom in the spring and the leaves change color in the fall, while snow blankets much of the area during the winter and the sun warms the air in the summer.  This area is full of breathtaking scenery year round.</p>",
