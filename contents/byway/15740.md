WV Route 72 provides beautiful views of the Cheat River Canyon. The river remains close to its primitive state for nearly six miles along the route, and with the exception of the town of Rowlesburg, there is little development along the byway. In fact, certain sections of the road give travelers the sensation of complete isolation. Numerous pulloffs provide views of the rugged river canyon, Buckhorn Run Waterfall and the Tray Run Viaduct. The region is also known for the rail and industrial sites that support mineral extraction and the railroads that served them. With the
growth of the whitewater rafting industry, the region is becoming equally well-known for its recreational opportunities.
