The Ormond Scenic Loop and Trail includes four state and six local public parks, as well as ten miles of gorgeous Florida beachfront. Take advantage of the unique opportunity to visit three “Old Florida” environments while driving, biking, or hiking along a connected figure-eight shaped corridor.

Take the opportunity on the corridor to observe varied plant and animal species along the beach, such as the endangered Florida Scrub Jay and nesting sea turtles. You can also view northern right whales and humpback
whales offshore during migration seasons. Keep your eyes peeled, and you might spy dolphins as well.

The Ormond Scenic Loop and Trail is an easily navigated loop of roadways traversing some of the most beautiful and diverse natural scenery remaining in all of Florida. There is ready access to the Atlantic Ocean and North Peninsula and to several state and public parks. If you're seeking a cultural and/or historic experience, you can find museums and historic public buildings and homes along the corridor, in Tomoka State Park, and in locations just off the corridor. Recreational opportunities also abound, with numerous parks and trails offering boating, fishing, hiking, swimming, bicycling, beach-walking, and much more. Vast expanses of water and natural Florida scrub vegetation create beautiful scenic vistas waiting to be photographed. With all it has to offer, this byway is truly a national treasure.
