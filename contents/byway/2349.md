The Green Mountain Byway runs on VT 100 through the towns of Waterbury and Stowe, between the spine of the northern Green Mountains to the west and the peaks of the Worcester Range to the east. Traveling along the byway provides stunning views of open meadows, farmlands and forests, all with a spectacular mountain backdrop. Historic homes, farmsteads, villages and mill sites are accessible all along the route as well as the area’s most prominent natural feature, Mount Mansfield, Vermont’s highest peak.
