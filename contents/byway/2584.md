A drive along the Puye Cliffs Scenic Byway offers a sampling of the cultural and historic areas of the Santa Clara Native Americans. As New Mexico's only state Scenic Byway located entirely on an Indian Pueblo, this route travels through a diverse landscape and exemplifes the natural wonders of New Mexico.

The byway stops at the Puye Cliff Dwellings and treats travelers to a vibrant 12th century heritage that permeates modern surroundings and beliefs. These ancient dwellings were carved into the jagged volcanic tufa and were eventually expanded to include adobe structures along the slopes and atop the numerous mesas.

The 14-mile Puye Scenic Byway is composed of Indian Road 565, 35 miles north of Santa Fe. The main Santa Clara village is located on the byway two miles north of Espa&ntilde;ola. The majority of the tribal lands included in the main village comprise a unique social, cultural, and residential area. Much of the City of Espa&ntilde;ola lies within the exterior boundaries of the reservation and within the visual corridor of the byway. The reservation also borders the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Note: Due to fire damage from the Cerro Grande Fire, this byway may be __CLOSED__. Please check before planning your trip.
