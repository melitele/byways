The Green Mountain Scenic Byway is a microcosm of Florida - rolling hills, small towns, rural communities, and stately and historic buildings with moss-draped live oaks shading the roadway. The byway is included in routes for several large, internationally recognized triathlons and is one of the most heavily used routes in the Southeast for bicyclists and motorcyclists.

This is also a great place for those who have a passion for bird watching. The Oakland Preserve boasts a 3100-foot long boardwalk, which winds through forested wetlands to the Lakeside Pavilion on Lake Apopka. The preserve is a favorite with birders and is a destination on the Great Florida Birding Trail.

Enjoy a relaxing evening going through the rural community of Ferndale, the small Town of Montverde (which, in English, is "Green Mountain"), and then through the historic and scenic Town of Oakland.
