Avenue of Pines Byway cuts right through the heart of Chippewa National Forest and borders the large Lake Winnibigoshish, revered by Minnesota anglers for walleye, northern pike and most other game fish. Other fine fishing waters include Cut Foot Sioux Lake, Squaw Lake, and many smaller lakes.

Nine forest service campgrounds, as well as countless resorts and private campgrounds, provide a wealth of places to stay and play in the woods and waters. The route offers views of mature red pine stands, sparkling lakes, marshes, and more. Bald eagle sightings are common, as well as deer, bear, porcupine, osprey, and many other species.
