Visitors can have a picture taken with the tow truck that was the inspiration for the character “Mater” from the “Cars” movies or discover Schermerhorn Park and the Southeast Kansas Nature Center south of Galena. Travelers can also learn about the importance of hydroelectricity in Riverton or enjoy a stop at the Eisler’s Brother Store, the location of a 1920’s Route 66 gas station. The stories of Baxter Springs, another town along the route, include those from Native American history and early battles of the Civil War. There are tours offered throughout the year, a variety of dining and lodging facilities available, and even locations that offer a chance to purchase Route 66 memorabilia.
