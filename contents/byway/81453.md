Drive along one of Alaska's greatest rivers on the Copper River Highway. With picturesque views of Alaskan wilderness, this state byway will take your breath away time and time again.  The area is rich in opportunities for outdoor recreation including camping, hiking, bird watching and fishing.

Always an industrious and travel-rich area, the delta of the Copper River spans 584 square miles of land that play host to over 500,000 migratory birds annually. It is known internationally as part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network.  The area has also served as a crossroads for Native peoples. Whether by kayak, dugout canoes, umiak, foot, or sled, this area has been well tracked for thousands of years and is simply waiting for the new generation of adventurers.
