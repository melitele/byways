In Maryland, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground is considered to be the “spine on the chapters of our American history.” Running through a National Heritage Area, the byway corridor showcases the memorable recreation opportunities, sights, and history that's only contained in the place “Where America Happened.”

Many historic sites line the route including the National Shrine of St Elizabeth Ann Seton in Emmitsburg, the National Museum of Civil War Medicine, the Roger Brooke Taney House (home of the 5th Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court), Rose Hill Manor (home of the 1st elected governor of Maryland), St. Paul’s Church in Point of Rocks, and the 1876 Point of Rocks Railroad Station.

The byway travels through one of the most important corridors of the Civil War, providing access to Gettysburg, Virginia, and Antietam and Monocacy Battlefields in Maryland. Our nation’s Presidents have found safety and relaxation at Camp David.

Journey Through Hallowed Ground serves urban populations along the eastern seaboard as a major gateway to nationally significant recreation areas, such as Catoctin Mountain Park and the C&O Canal. Three CCC-era recreational demonstration areas are open to the public and easily accessed from the route, and Big Hunting Creek is said to be the best fly-fishing stream for trout in the state.
