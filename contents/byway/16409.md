This 13.7 mile scenic loop within the Theodore Roosevelt National Park gives access to superb camping, backpacking, birdwatching, hiking, and horseback riding. You can drink in exhilarating vistas from the Riverbend Overlook, which is a short walk from a parking lot. You can also canoe and kayak the Little Missouri, which follows the route.

This park was named after President Roosevelt because he attributed much of his political motivation to the experiences he had in North Dakota parks.

Regarding Roosevelt and this park, the National Park Service site says, "Here in the North Dakota badlands, where many of his personal concerns first gave rise to his later environmental efforts, Roosevelt is remembered with a national park that bears his name and honors the memory of this great conservationist. Theodore Roosevelt National Park is in the colorful North Dakota badlands and is home to a variety of plants animals, including bison, prairie dogs, and elk."
