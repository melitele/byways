  "fullDescription": "<p>Step back in time to rural Danville, and spend an afternoon or a whole day in the beautiful Amish countryside on US 62 to Route 514, the Gateway to Amish Country Scenic Byway. One of Knox County's many locally maintained trails, the Mohican Valley Trail, parallels the byway between Danville and Brinkhaven, and is a breathtaking way to see the beauties of Knox County. These trails were once large, vacated railroad beds that cut through the land, but the citizens of Knox County came up with an ingenious idea. Local volunteers paved the old rail trenches and turned them into nature and sightseeing trails that amble across the countryside, passing through towns and crossing rivers.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>While traveling the byway on your way to Brinkhaven, don't let the landscape's natural beauty distract you from seeing the Bridge of Dreams, a National Landmark. This bridge is the second largest covered bridge in the United States, and spans 370 feet across the Mohican River.</p>  \r\n",
